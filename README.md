# Battle Memes
Welcome to the future of social media! Our goal here at Battle Memes is to create a social media platform geared around laughter and entertainment.
I strive to give users a new perspective on memes by allowing them to post and vote on memes.

See our project proposal [here on our GitHub.io page](https://lbuttorff.github.io/battle-memes-play/)

## Framework
I have relaunched this idea in Play because there were too many setbacks in Spring. I was not learning, which is one of the top pillars of why I am a developer. So now we are doing this implementation in Play and I will likely be posting this to some low cost service once it is up and running, i.e. Digital Ocean.
