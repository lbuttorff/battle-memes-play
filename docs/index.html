    <h1>Battle Memes</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Battle Memes is a brand new social media platform for comparing the greatest memes. Have you ever wanted to see whether or not your funny cat photo is, in public opinion, better than someone else's? This platform allows you to do just that, and so much more. The idea is to create a posting site similar to Twitter and Facebook but specifically for funny photo comparisons and memes.</p>

    <h2>Project Design</h2>
    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <p>The important technologies for this application are Play framework, JQuery, SBT, Ebean, and MySQL.</p>
    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Sign up</li>
        <li>Sign in</li>
        <li>View Global News Feed</li>
        <li>View your Posts page</li>
        <li>Post text, photo, video to Posts page</li>
        <li style="text-decoration:line-through;">View another user's Posts page</li>
        <li>Open challenges tab to view old and ongoing Challenges</li>
        <li>Vote on Challenges in the Challenges tab</li>
        <li style="text-decoration:line-through;">Stretch Ideas
            <ul>
                <li>Request friendships</li>
                <li>Accept/Decline friend requests</li>
                <li>View Friends' Posts pages</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Extra Design Documents</h3>
    <p>Nothing needed as of now.</p>

    <h2>Project Schedule</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <h4><li>March 29</h4>
            <p>This milestone included the HTML buildouts of Registration and Login. I also began implementation of Spring Security.</p>
        </li>
        <h4><li>April 12</h4>
            <p>This milestone included a massive overhaul into the Play framework. With this, the completion of user creation, sign up, sign in, and creating new posts. The global feed is also accessible and it displays the new posts in descending order by post ID.</p>
        </li>
        <h4><li>April 26</h4>
            <p>This milestone will include back-end implementation of Challenges and voting. It will also include the ability to view a Challenges tab that shows current Challenges. A user will also be able to create a new Challenge by selecting a Post in the Global feed.</p>
        </li>
        <h4><li>May 4</h4>
            <p>This milestone will include any remaining testing of the afore mentioned tasks and the final database/persistence implementation.</p>
        </li>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Project Justification</h2>
    <h3>Novelty</h3>
    <p>This project came about by determining what useful applications exist out there for social media and what features they lack. While the idea is rather laughable at first thought, the design of the application is to bring a new, more laughter filled, experience to sharing media on the internet. Other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter do not have this focus on silly social connecting.</p>
    <h3>Complexity</h3>
    <p>This project includes some work that I have done in the past, but, more importantly, it includes new implementations of technology I have yet to work with. One of these is file uploads and file management with a MySQL database. That feature will require the most amount of work and being able to quickly serve pages with multiple images and videos that are being put head-to-head for the voting system will be quite challenging.</p>
